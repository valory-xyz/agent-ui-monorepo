    Sharpe Ratio Threshold: Increased from 1 to 1.2 to focus on pools with better risk-adjusted returns.
    Depth Score Threshold: Raised from 50 to 60 to ensure we only enter highly liquid pools.
    IL Risk Score Threshold: Adjusted from -0.05 to -0.03 to minimize exposure to impermanent loss.
    Minimum Composite Score Ratio: Increased from 0.5 to 0.6 to apply stricter filtering on pool selection.
  These updates should help us capture more profitable opportunities while keeping things safe. Let me know if you’d like me to tweak anything further!`,
